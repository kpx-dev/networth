## What is FIRE?

[FIRE](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/) stands for Financial Independence / Retirement Early. The core concept it teaches is save enough money so you can just live on 4.5% (based on [Trinity study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study)) yearly withdrawl rate from your investment capital gain. For example, if you want to retire when you turn 40 with $100k/year expense, then you need at least $2.2M networth by 40.

Simple math:
4.5% * $2.2M = $100k
